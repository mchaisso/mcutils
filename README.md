This is a set of tools I find helpful for working with whole genome
alignments stored in the SAM format.  


The programs are:
+ samToBed - This version of a sam <-> bed converter allows the calculation of identity
+ samToDot - Create a file that may be rendered into a dotplot using RenderPlot.R
+ samLiftover - Transform coordinates from the query genome to target using the SAM file as a mapping.
